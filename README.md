# Used Car Data Scraping and Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves scraping used car data from the Cars24 website for multiple cities using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. The data is then analyzed to derive insights into the second-hand car market.

### Goals

- **Data Collection**: Retrieve detailed information about used cars listed on Cars24.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns in the used car market.
- **Visualization**: Create visual representations of the data to facilitate better understanding and decision-making.
- **Insights**: Provide actionable insights for stakeholders in the second-hand car industry.

### Techniques Used

- **Web Scraping**: Automated data extraction using Selenium WebDriver and BeautifulSoup.
- **Data Cleaning**: Processing and preparing scraped data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical and visual methods to examine and summarize the main characteristics of the data.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs to visualize trends and relationships in the data.

### Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language used for scripting.
- **Selenium**: Web automation tool for web scraping.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computing in Python.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

### Dataset Used

The dataset used in this project consists of information scraped from the Cars24 website. It includes details such as:

- **Brand**: The brand of the car (e.g., Toyota, Honda, Hyundai).
- **Driven Kilometers**: The number of kilometers the car has been driven.
- **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the car (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG).
- **Transmission Type**: Whether the car has an automatic or manual transmission.
- **Specifications**: Additional specifications of the car.
- **City**: The city where the car is listed for sale.
- **Price**: The listed price of the car.
- **EMI**: The monthly EMI amount (if available).

### Methodology

1. **Setting Up Selenium WebDriver**: Initialize a WebDriver session using Chrome.
2. **Scraping Data**: Automate the extraction of used car listings from Cars24.
3. **Saving Data**: Store the scraped data into a structured format (e.g., CSV).
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze and visualize the data to uncover insights.
5. **Visualization**: Present findings using charts and graphs.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarize key findings and insights for stakeholders.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates a practical application of web scraping and data analysis techniques to gain insights into the second-hand car market. The methodology outlined provides a systematic approach to extracting, analyzing, and visualizing data from online sources.
